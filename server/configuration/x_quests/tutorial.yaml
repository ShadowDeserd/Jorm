    in_progress: |
      Im stuck in some weird empty place, here I met someone
      They asked me to bring them a corpse?
      I can find something to kill in the "hole" by 
      the northern wall they said. 
    completed: |
      I got the corpse, I should probably go back to 
      the shadowy figure and give it to them...
      They are by the south-west corner.
    turned_in: |
      I got them the corpse of a mouse, they told me to head to the 
      south-east corner, and type "go crossroad" to get out of here.
